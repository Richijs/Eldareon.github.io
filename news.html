				   <p>According to From Software’s Dark Souls II director, Yui Tanimura, challenge is one of the 
					things that made the original game so satisfying.</p>
						
					<div class="hidden1" >
						<p>But as word of a push toward more ‘accessibility’ in the new game spread across the internet, 
						fans began to worry. News that creator Hidetaka Miyazaki was not directing the sequel only made matters worse.</p>

						<p>Would the sequel be dumbed down? Would it be made easier? Would it go for the “Skyrim audience?”</p>

						<p>“I would like to clarify here that we do not have any plan to make the game easier,” 
							Tanimura tells me. “As Dark Souls focused on giving a sense of satisfaction to players, 
							Dark Souls II is also pursuing to provide this sense. We cherish Dark Souls fans’ voices and w
							ould like to improve this game based on their voices to let them enjoy a highly challenging game.”</p>

						<p>Along these lines, the developer has no plans to include options within the game to 
							easier for more casual players.</p>

						<p>“We do not plan on having an Easy Mode,” says Tanimura, “since we are creating this 
							th a thought that challenge and difficulty are core elements of the game.”</p>

						<p>No Easy Mode should certainly come as a relief to many Souls fans.</p>

						<p>When the idea was floated last year—accidentally, or as the result of a poor 
							translation—there was a huge backlash online. The notion of an easier mode for some 
							players in a game so tightly built around a multi-player experience that was supposed to be, 
							at its core, very challenging rubbed many people the wrong way, and with good reason.</p>

						<p>But Tanimura says that the “sense of satisfaction achieved through challenges is a great feeling for players.”</p>

						<p>The very success of the game depended on that challenge, Tanimura notes. “Dark Souls succeeded because 
							more players than we expected welcomed this thought and there were not many games offering this same 
							sense of accomplishment at the time. What we have to do for Dark Souls II is to stick to this consistent stance.”</p>

						<p>The biggest surprise at the VGAs was not Alison Haislip calling Gabe Newell "Gary," 
							but the announcement of Dark Souls 2 with the epic CG trailer above.</p>
			
						<div class="hidden2">
						<p>Dark Souls is one of the most challenging and rewarding games to be released in ages, 
							so the news of a sequel was well-received at the VGAs. And it was especially surprising—there 
							was nary a whisper about the announcement ahead of time, and the Souls series has so far seen 
							two iterations without a direct sequel.</p>

						<p>Namco Bandai even confirmed that Dark Souls 2 will release this gen on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. 
							While we'd love to play a Souls sequel on next-gen consoles, we'd rather play this one within 
							the next year or so than have to wait any longer than that. There's been no official word on a release date, though.</p>

						<p>Any Souls fans out there are going to want to read these quotes from the press release:</p>
