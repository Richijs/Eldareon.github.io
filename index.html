Dark Souls 2 curses you right from the beginning. Your character begins as a faceless amnesiac who is drawn to the kingdom of Drangleic, where memories are forgotten and heroes become hollows—undead who require souls to keep their humanity. Your only chance to fight the curse is to collect four great, old souls and confront the king of this cursed land. You'll need to collect lots of lesser souls to level up you skills, purchase items and services, and trade with those you meet. If you die (sorry, when you die) you lose the souls you've collected and must find the spot you died in to retrieve them. Fail before you hit that spot and they're gone forever. That will happen a lot, too.
<br></br>
Like the first game, exploring a new area requires patience and risk in equal measure. I love the dread I experience when I approach a fog gate, a sort of progress marker that often means harder challenges lie ahead, including bosses. I question whether I'm ready to move forward. Sometimes I am—often, I am not. It's at moments like this when I feel that Dark Souls 2 is trolling me. I encounter one fog gate in Earthen Peak, a factory for poisonous sludge, and steel myself for a brutal duel with the boss I'd been expecting. I change weapons, add buffs to do more magic damage, consume life gems to heal full health, and return myself to full humanity by using a Human Effigy. But though the open gate, there's only a bonfire—the game's safe haven. All of my prep was for nothing.
<br></br>
Even while fast traveling through bonfires, though, Drangleic never feels much like an open world. Instead, the game pushes you in specific directions, especially in the early game. The Forest of Fallen Giants will lead to a specific path, and when you eventually get to the end, the game just warps you back to Majula. The three other spokes work in much the same way, and rarely connect to each other. Part of the magic of Dark Souls was how the world eventually connects its puzzle pieces to each other, and discovering the shortcuts you could take made the game feel like one solid world.
<br></br>
Dark Souls 2 also struggles to commit to one of its boldest gameplay changes: the importance of darkness. Early info on the game highlighted how players would need to light torches and navigate environments steeped in darkness, as yet another way the game would fray your nerves. In practice, lighting the way is rarely as important as it should be. Torches feel optional in most of the game's areas, and the sections that reward sacrificing your shield arm to carry them, such as No-Man's Wharf and The Gutter, never quite reward that sacrifice enough to be worth the vulnerability. It's a disappointing result to what could have been a key gameplay mechanic, especially since those lighting effects look so spectacular on the PC.
<br></br>
Dark Souls was a brilliant game that didn't explain itself well. Many new players were frustrated even by the tutorial because the game didn't teach its secrets to them. Dark Souls 2 fixes that by giving you way more information about its items, skills, and world, liberating its designers to create even more complex challenges. It is more accessible for new players, but not at the expense of being brutal—I've died more than 150 times in 60 hours. I curse out loud every time a hollow pushes me off an edge, at every fire arrow I can't dodge, at The Pursuer every god damned time I fight him. I die, over and over, one stupid mistake after another. But even though failing sucks, succeeding in Dark Souls 2 feels absolutely amazing. I'll die a hundred more times just to feel that good when I win.
